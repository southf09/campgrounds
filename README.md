# Welcome to the Campground Review App!

## Steps taken so far:

- Necessary npm packages added (express, mongoose, ejs)
- Express set up and link tested, renders ejs from the 'views' folder
- Models folder created to export Mongoose Schema to be linked in main app.js file
- Placeholder Schema creation made to test link between the app and mongodb
